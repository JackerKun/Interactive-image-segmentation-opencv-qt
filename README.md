# image-matting-opencv-qt
This is a simple interactive image matting app written by python opencv and pyqt

This app apply Grabcut algorithm in opencv for matting images. Grabcut is an improved version of Graph cut algorithm. Check these papers([paper1](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdz/Papers/BVZ-pami01-final.pdf), [paper2](http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~yuri/Papers/iccv01.pdf)) for detail information~~

The gui part is mostly from this great work [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg). It is quite a good example for pygt beginner!
